d3 = "Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 our technology advance, so do are lives. Computers are a perfect way to better our way of life in ways that are benificial to us and future generations. The use of computers, and the @CAPS5 alone allow us to learn about the way of life in other places on @LOCATION4 talk to people faraway, and express ourselves. Computers give us a bright future. First many people, actually @PERCENT1 of the worlds population are generally stationary, and line in a local town or city environments. This is why computers are so helpful because they give @CAPS2 a way to research other places around the globe. @CAPS3 can create an interest in other cultures, and shape our opinions @CAPS2 @CAPS3 discover things about other places. From there, @CAPS3 can look at different topics in a wide spread point of view. In doing this @CAPS3 will connect to other ways of life. @CAPS2 philosopher and poet @PERSON1 state\" @CAPS3 learn about ourselves through the discovery of others.\" @CAPS4, another particularly handy function of the @CAPS5 through computers is @CAPS3 can communicate with people who live far away, when @CAPS3 couldn't visit otherwise. A @LOCATION2 study showed that actually @PERCENT2 of use of the computer is communication with sites like facebook or @CAPS9. A scientist in @LOCATION3, @PERSON3, says @CAPS3 @CAPS2 humans tend to enjoy communication because it gives @CAPS2 a sense of unity. This is why so many companies are realizing that sites like @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS6, and @ORGANIZATION1 are gaining in popularity.\" And this is true. It is enjoyable to @CAPS7, talk, or email others. Without computers, this couldn\'t be possible. Lastly, computers give us the chance to express our ideas like never before. Now, stars aren\'t only made in @LOCATION1, but now you can make yourself famous on @CAPS8 or @CAPS9. Just ask @PERSON2, who\'s voice reached out and caught the attention of a major record company. Now, everyone knows his name and listens to his music. Like @PERSON2, the more wordy folks can express themselves by blogging their opinions. \" About half of computer use, \" says @CAPS1 to computer weekly, @PERSON4,\" is using blogs and videos to state one\'s ideas.\" @CAPS3 can persuade others to think @CAPS2 @CAPS3 do and discover thngs that @CAPS3 have discovered. Self-expression is very important to society, and this is why computers have such an affect on people. @CAPS2 it is clear, computers have a positive affect on people and society. They allow us to learn about faraway places, communicate with others, and inspire the world around us with our ideas. Welcome to the future."
d4 = "Dear Local Newspaper: @CAPS1 you know that over half our nation own home computers? Recently, though, some experts have been concerned whether or not computers benefit society. I have been asked to state my opinion and I believe computers have a positive effect becuase, they are mandatory for work, allow online socialization, and expand traveling. After reading this, I am sure you will agree. Firstly, computers are mandatory to have for work and @ORGANIZATION1. Students keep their essays, study guides, and home work updates on files in the @CAPS5. Offices would not be able to function @CAPS8 computers; workers rely on the internet email system. An interviews with a student from @ORGANIZATION1 says, \"I use my @CAPS5 for everything; I would not survive the workload @CAPS8 @CAPS3.\" @CAPS2 asked why, he replied, \"@CAPS3 keeps everything organized, and is an easier way to research topics.\" A lawyer said, \"You can not support a client if you don't have the right tools, and a @CAPS5 is on @MONEY1 those tools.\" @CAPS4, @CAPS8 computers offices would crumble and students grades would drop. Could you imagine writing a newspaper @CAPS8 a @CAPS5? Secondly internet access allows people to meet new people. Many websites such as '@CAPS6' and '@CAPS7' allow people to reconnect with old friends, and make new ones. @PERCENT1 @MONEY1 the nation owns accounts on socializing websites, and @PERCENT2 @MONEY1 the nation says their friend groups have expanded to the groups (according to a poll taken). A psychologist explains, \"Some people are too shy to meet new friends in person; online bloom.\" @CAPS8 internet, citizens @MONEY1 @LOCATION1 would know little about other countries' people. My next reason, however is even greater. Lastly, @CAPS8 internet, people would do for less traveling. Internet allows citizens to research places they would like to visit and buy transportation to their destination. @CAPS3 also is an easy and effective way @MONEY1 booking where the tourist shall stay. Apoll taken by @ORGANIZATION2 airports shows that @PERCENT3 @MONEY1 the travelers book their flights online and @CAPS8 online ticketing 'the wait to book your flights would be unbearabley long; or stop travelers completely' (quote from a worker). My people and I went to various airports and train stations across the country and interviewed @NUM1 people each. We inquired about how the bought their tickets and @PERCENT4 @MONEY1 them said online. \"@CAPS9 do you mean, how? On the internet @MONEY1 course! no one could get anywhere if we stood in lines all day!\" said a person interviewed. Airports make @MONEY1 for the @LOCATION2 government, and @CAPS8 internet less people would travel. There for, computers are mandatory. Computers have a positive effect on owners; since they allow easy organization and research, online socializing and better ways @MONEY1 booking transportation. @CAPS8 computers internet access, our business would crumble, then the economy would follow. I know you agree with me."
d5 = "Dear Local newspaper, @CAPS1 you have a computer at home you enjoy? Computers are a big thing now in life, they help with many things. Such as staying organized, studies, and even entertainment. These are the three topics I will focus on, because I @CAPS1 believe that computers are useful and people use them a help to make life a lot more easy. Let me start by saying: \"I am a man who enjoys computers, as a way to talk to friends, listen and search music, watch videos on youtube, get school work done, and much more! Although, on main point is it helps me stay orginized. I can make many folders to store my work in, rather then losing or spilling something on the paper if I wrote it out. I can have my music, homework, projects, does work, videos, pictures, and much more saved and orginized so I know where it is everytime I go to find it. There can be no more, \"my dog ate my homework\" excuse. Moving on to the next topic. As I mentioned you can save work onto your computer, you can add without earasing as well, the work becomes neat and perfect everytime. So when you teacher is grading on neatness no worry. You can also look up information on any topic you are working on in class witch alows you to get. More information, the better the grade. Spelling is not a factor now, because your computer tells you when a word is spelt wrong. It even gives you suggestions on how to spell the word by underlining it with a red squigle line. This really helps because a lot of people have hard times with spelling. You can even get @CAPS2 to play a book you are reading, witch helps you learn new words that you @MONTH1 not have knew how to sound out. Teachers can even post notes on school websites of homework, when projects are @CAPS1, ext. No more, \"I didn't know/remember what was homework/project due. Lastly, entertainment is the biggest thing with computers. People go on every day uploading videos, pictures, blogs, and just about what ever they want. Games are played on computers by younger kids, just learning, while older kids are enjoying playing maze, driving, shooting, adventure, and much more types of games. Just about everyone using a computer knows of some chat website in witch they use to communicate with any one. Myspace, facebook, twitter, and so much more are used by people to talk, express how they feel to everyone/to just let it out), show love to someone, send birthday wishes, to @CAPS1 what ever. Those are endless possibilities at entertainment on a computer. Without a dobt, no more, \"I\'m bored\". @CAPS1 you use your computer to @CAPS1 anything like this? If so you must enjoy it. People use computer for every thing from work to expressing feelings. Now what side are you at?"
d6 = "Computers are used world wide everyday, and most of the time @CAPS2 is used for a good reason. Computers help out by making @CAPS2 possible to get all the info you want, like for a trip. @CAPS1 you wanted to go to a close but fancy restaurant you @MONTH1 use a computer so you know how far. Computers also help out, making @CAPS2 possible to talk to friends that you haven't seen for years. @CAPS2 is also great way to meet new people. Let's say you are really stressed at work or school and you forget your book, you can usually bring @CAPS2 up on the computer and do @CAPS2 there. First, computers help out with traveling, sight seeing and lots more. When you travel, dont you want to know everything? And the biggest detail you want to know is the cost and the computer can usually give you a close to exact price for everything. Now that help's out a bunch when your traveling the world. And also when your site seeing you usually want to find either the most amazing or romantic spot were you are. And @CAPS1 you type in \"the most romantic spot in somers\" @CAPS2 should come up with a bunch of spots. So dont drive to miles just to get a map or brochure, use your computer and print one off. Second, @CAPS1 there was a friend you haven't seen in years and you want to talk, you can go on the computer. The computer helps in so many ways @CAPS2 could even tell you were this person lives and you could surprise visit him/her. When your on the computer, you can even meet new friends and have conversations with them. and even meet them someday. And @CAPS1 you and that new friend get along then mabey you and that person could be best friends. So @CAPS1 you haven't seen or talked to someone in a while that you knew use the computer to have a chat. Third, say your teacher or boss yelled at you today and no one has been nice to you all day and you forget your homework book or paperwork. Were do you go? the computer, @CAPS2 can bring most any paper work or work book you need to get the job done. @CAPS1 you forgot your homework book, you dont want to get a falling grade. on this homework. So you go to your computer from there. And @CAPS1 you forgot your paper work, and @CAPS1 you didn't finish this project for work tonight you would be fired, you could just go on the computer, find the work and finish @CAPS2. Also save your job. So that why computers help out so much in this lifetime. Last, that is why in this lifetime you need computers. They help us with our vacation trips. They help with conversation with old friends we haven't seen forever. Also they help with your school and job work. At least @PERCENT1 of our population use computers every day and with out them our society would colaps/ @DATE1. So think about the decision you are making and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 will benefit our society or make our society @DATE1 to its knees."
d66 = "Dear, local newspaper, @CAPS1 you like computers? I @CAPS1, computers help you learn about all kinds of things. Plus computers let you chat to people on there computer even if you can't call them. Another reason why I love computer are because when I have to write a project I can just type it!!! Computers make eveything easier. So, @CAPS2 consider liking computers. Initially, imagine you have a project due in two days. Your mom can't drive you to the library and you have no information on the subject. But hey, don't you have a computer. You can use the computer to lock up your subject and a @CAPS3 different websites will come speed quick to your screen. Most of then will help you learn about the subject and then you have time to finish it and hang out with your friends. Secondly, @CAPS4 @CAPS5!!! you frogot what page of the book your suspose to read. Also you lost all your friends contacts. Not to fear super duper computer is here. You can email or chat to your friends online and see what pages to read and get there phone numbers back. Did you know @PERCENT1 out of @NUM1 People said that the chat & email programs are @CAPS6 because they can contact friends, family, and co-workers. Finally, you can type your essay on the computer. Writing a @NUM2 paragraph essay takes to long, so use your computer to help you out. Go to microsoft office and type your essay. Computers make writing an essay really easy. @PERCENT2 out of @NUM3 people said they like typing on the computer more then writing it on @CAPS7. in conclusion, Computers are @CAPS6 tecnollogy when you have to chat to someone. Also when you learn about something. Another reason why computers are @CAPS6 is because you can type essays & papers, @CAPS8, @CAPS2 change you @CAPS10 of computers are bad to computers make us @CAPS11!"
d7 = "Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects computers have on people is a positive effect. Three main reasons are that people learn more about cultures, places, and some people work online. @CAPS1 first reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because they help you learn about cultures around the world. Learning about cultures is very important because if people travel they need to know how they can respect each other. @CAPS1 second reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because they help you learn about places around the world the world. Learning about places is very important because you could get lost. It also helps you by telling you which places are famous to visit. @CAPS1 third reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because some people find jobs online. Other people work online. This benefits people in a positive way. In conclusion computers have a positive effect on people because its helps people learn about cultures, places, and jobs around them."
d77 = "Dear readers, People around the world are starting to use computers now more, often, but theirs also people that dont agree that it benefits society, @CAPS1 not one of those people. I agree that this benefits society. One reason why I agree is because sometimes theirs teens and even adults that can chat online with their friends if they cant contact them in any other way. Another reason is because in all school teacher give their students project to do over vacation or weekends, for the projects they can look for information in the computer. The last reason is because computers can give ability to learn more about things they didnt know before. In my opinion I agree with computers benefiting society. Teens, kids and even adults would like to talk with their friends so they can get on the computer and chat with them if theirs no other way to contact them, @CAPS2 easy. You only have to @NUM1) get in the computer, @NUM2) get into a site were you know your friend might be @NUM3) log in or register in if you never been into that site @NUM4) last but not least look @NUM4 your friend to chat will teachers always give their students work for example like projects. Kids also do projects on weekends or vacation and so you dont have to go to a library to check out a book you could always get on the computer and look for the information you need their. Computers give you abilitys to learn information you didnt know before for example if your bored and you dont got nothing to do get in the computer and look up information about things like nature, books your looking for etc. I agree with computers benefiting society but not everyone, @NUM3 reason why I agree is kids can chat online with their friends, look up information for projects and find information they never knew about, what do you think @CAPS1 I right or wrong."
d8 = "Dear @CAPS1, I, agree that computers are benefits society. The computers have positive effect on people like hand-eye coordination. I helps you learn about other country religios, and other thing. You can communicate, meet other people, and chat tru computers. Another positive fact about computer is that you can find all the information you need and fast. In other words is that computer help a lot of people."
d88 = "Dear: @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. My name is @PERSON1 and I am concernd about people around the world are use computer is to much during the day. Some compute's are bad because there are glitche\'s in the computer and every one has a myspace and myspaces has a viries and it leaves a vires in your computer and your computer shut\'s down or goes slow. Also people can hack your computer and you cant find out about and every thing that was on your computer can go around the world. People can kno your most secread\'s and more. Finly you can get caught macking movies on your computer and go to jail and your business will be out."
